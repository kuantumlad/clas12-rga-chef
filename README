Directory containing the necessary software for:
(1) decoding (SWIF) 
(2) reconstruction (COATJAVA and CLARA)


Instructions for decoding:

to start a workflow to process subfiles 40-49 for a run from the runList.txt do the following

./scripts/gen-decoding.py -- workflow v0 --runGroup rga --input /mss/clas12/rg-a/data/ --workDir /volatile/clas12/rg-a/production/decoded/coatV5bp7p8/tmp/ --outDir /volatile/clas12/rg-a/production/decoded/coatV5bp7p8/ --runFile ../runList.txt --coatjava /work/clas12/rg-a/software/clara-5bp7p8/plugins/clas12/ --fileRegex .*clas[_A-Za-z]*_(\d+)\.evio\.(0004\d) --model 2


OUTLINE OF WORKFLOW

1) a cron job wgets the production run spreadsheet every 24 hours. 
2) Python script is executed to compare the current spreadsheet with the previous one. An updated run list txt file is generated containing the new runs.
3) A script executes the gen decoding for the new run list - generates new directories, send jobs to farm, etc.
4) Next a script uses the new run list to check if there are 10 decoded files for each run before sending out reconstruction runs
